# Proyecto 1: Data Science Salary Estimator: Project Overview
- Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE - $11k ) to help data scientist negotiate their income when they get a job.
- Scrapped over 1000 jobs descriptions from glassdor using python and selenium.
- Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws and spark.
- Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridSearchCV to reach the best model.
- Built a client facing API using Flask.

This is one of the most important challenges in the plattform Kaggle. It's called Titanic, and you can find the details [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
